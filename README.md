## Description 📁

This application is a CLI. Once you've cloned down the repo, use the schema.sql file to create your database. Feel free to use the seeds.sql file as well to get yourself started with dummy data, or import your own. When you have established a connection using your credentials, simply follow the installation instructions, and then type `node index.js` or `npm start` to begin. You will be prompted with a list of questions ranging from 'View All Employees' to 'Add Employee' all of which will be saved to your database for future reference. This project is the culmination of last week's sprint where we learned MySQL.
